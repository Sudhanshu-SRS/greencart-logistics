# ðŸŽ¯ Excel Data Integration Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Driver Data Integration

- **âœ“ Converted Excel driver data** to MongoDB documents
- **âœ“ Added 10 drivers** with exact names from your Excel sheet
- **âœ“ Calculated past 7-day work hours** from pipe-separated values
- **âœ“ Set current shift hours** for each driver
- **âœ“ Implemented fatigue status** calculation based on work hours

### 2. Route Data Integration

- **âœ“ Created 10 routes** with specific distances and locations
- **âœ“ Set traffic levels** (Low/Medium/High) for realistic simulation
- **âœ“ Configured base delivery times** for each route
- **âœ“ Mapped Mumbai area locations** for authentic feel

### 3. Order Data Integration

- **âœ“ Generated 50 orders** distributed across all routes
- **âœ“ Set realistic order values** ranging from â‚¹650 to â‚¹4200
- **âœ“ Balanced order distribution** (5 orders per route)
- **âœ“ Linked orders to specific routes** for proper simulation

### 4. Database Seeding

- **âœ“ Updated seeder.js** with your exact Excel data
- **âœ“ Replaced sample data** with real Excel values
- **âœ“ Added data verification script** for easy validation
- **âœ“ Created MongoDB startup instructions** in README

## ðŸ”§ How to Use the New Data

### 1. Start MongoDB

```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# macOS
brew services start mongodb-community

# Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### 2. Seed Database

```bash
cd Backend
node utils/seeder.js
```

### 3. Verify Data

```bash
node utils/verify-data.js
```

### 4. Start Application

```bash
# Backend
npm run dev

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd ../frontend-1
npm run dev
```
